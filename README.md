ASCII Art:

-   [Skull - no artist listed](http://www.asciiworld.com/-Death-Co-.html)
-   [Hat by Tom Youderian](https://www.asciiart.eu/clothing-and-accessories/hats)
-   [Boots by Riitta Rasimus](https://www.asciiart.eu/clothing-and-accessories/footwear)

(Minor edits by me to remove backticks so these would actually print properly, and to add velcro to the skull.)

The word list was culled from the following pages:
-   [The Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation](http://www.lrgaf.org/guide/western-cowboy.htm)
-   [Cowboy Showcase](http://www.cowboyshowcase.com/the-people--the-land.html#.XBE-_ydRf_Q)
-   [Legends of America](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-slang/)

The code in Inquirer that uses regex to validate the user input was taken from some of the inquirer examples -- specifically [pizza.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/blob/master/packages/inquirer/examples/pizza.js).

If you have any questions, run into any bugs, or find a really good ascii cow skull (I found cows, and skulls, but now cow skulls), hit me up at ry.e.desoto@gmail.com.

#### further notes:

There is velcro inside the hat to match the velcro on the skull. You may not be able to see it, but I assure you: it's there.
